## Why fork this Ghost Theme ?

- **Enhancements** — This theme has been enhanced to feature some elements that are not present in the original theme. IMHO, these are essential enhancements that are hard to live without:
	- **Buttons** (unicorn UI)
	- **Icons** (Font Awesome 5)
	- **Code Syntax** (highlight.js) 
	- **Grid** (great to make pricing table)
- **Drop-in replacement** — No special tweaks to do. It will work out of the box.
- **Code Injection** — Take a look those snippets in this [Git repo](https://github.com/firepress-org/Code-Injection-Ghost). It’s an easy way to customize your theme.
- **Curated** — This theme was carefully selected out of hundreds of Ghost Themes. See more of them in our [Ghost-Theme-Curated-Collection ](https://github.com/firepress-org/Ghost-Theme-Curated-Collection/tree/master/01_go).
