# FirePress_Klimax2

## Why forking this Ghost Theme ?

**Live Demo** â€” See this theme in action (wip).

**Enhancements** â€” This theme is an enhanced version of the theme **Casper** made by the Ghost foundation. Here are the features I added:

- **Icons** (Font Awesome 5)
- Juicy **buttons**
- **Code Syntax** (highlight.js) 
- **Grid** (See it as an avance table)
- Minified file (CSS and JS)

**Drop-in replacement** â€” You can use it as a drop-in replacement of the original Casper theme.

**Curated** â€” Itâ€™s one a the few themes that pass the Â« ITâ€™S A GO Â» test. See the curated collection [I maintain here](https://github.com/firepress-org/Ghost-Theme-Curated-Collection/tree/master/01_go).

**Compatibility** â€” This theme will work on [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) >= **1.0**.
